* [ ] In progress: Stretch: Redo the test page so the user can access the same functionality in a sleek react app with a nice UI/UX.

## Getting started - reference documentation from the original [here](https://github.com/lambdaschool-pm/Secret-Gists)

Authentication (logging a user in and ensuring they and only they have access to their information) is one of the most important security aspects of a modern Web application. A common practice is to use [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), which allows your application to depend on a trusted provider that manages user logins and the associated issues (multifactor authentication, password recovery, etc.). [Many major tech companies provide this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OAuth_providers) - for our purposes we're building an app to store and read secret gists (snippets of text stored on GitHub), so we'll be using GitHub as a provider.

Start by [reading the GitHub REST v3 API authentication info](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/basics-of-authentication/) -
it's okay if some of it doesn't make sense yet, but the general idea is you'll need to use tokens that certify your identity, and send the appropriate HTTP requests with them. The documentation uses Ruby/Rails in some examples, but [there is a Node.js example](https://github.com/github/platform-samples/tree/master/api/javascript/es2015-nodejs) that you should definitely look at as well.

For developing our app we'll use the [official Node.js GitHub library](https://github.com/octokit/node-github).


## Interactively using a REST API

The [GitHub REST v3 API documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/) shows the range of operations you can perform, and before development you should try playing with a few of the examples using `curl` (should be available in whatever package manager your operating system uses). Many of the basic operations don't require authentication, as they just retrieve public data. For an example, try running:

```
curl -i "https://api.github.com/repos/vmg/redcarpet/issues?state=closed"
```

This should cause a bunch of JSON (the format the API uses to return data) to scroll by, with various descriptive fields like `created_at` and `url`.

After a few non-authenticated operations, the next step is to authenticate. The most basic way to do this:

```
curl -u username https://api.github.com/user
```

Replace `username` with your GitHub username (keep the /user in the path the same), and after running that command you'll be asked for your password. Enter it and you should see returned some JSON with information about you as a GitHub user. If you have [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) or similar installed you can also try this workflow using a GUI.

Interactively typing your password is burdensome and not a great practice - a better way to authorize is with an OAuth token. The simplest way to do this is to [generate a token manually](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and then run:

```
curl -u username:token https://api.github.com/user
```

Replace `username` and `token` as appropriate, and the rest should be the same as the request where you logged in with a password. Note that this token really is just as sensitive as your password - you don't want to share it in plaintext or check it in to your git repository.

## Building an application using a REST API

REST APIs accept HTTP requests and return (usually) JSON - in principle you can use the HTTP functionality built in to your language/framework and program the API interactions "from scratch." This is a good exercise, but in practice most well-supported APIs have official libraries that build the requests for you and expose objects and methods so you can interact with them naturally in your code.

We will build our application using Express. The first step will be to register a new OAuth token. [Do so from the GitHub webpage](https://github.com/settings/tokens) - you should set it to have permission to create gists.

You will then see a page with a personal access token that will only ever
display once - copy it somewhere safe, and treat it as a password! That it, don't paste it into your code to check in, don't send over chat/email, etc. Instead, you should set it as an environment variable:

To use it, set the token in a `.env` file in the repository. The starter file has some help with this task.  Open the file called `dotenv`, paste in your token as described in the file, and resave the file with a new name of `.env`.  Be sure to not check in the  `.env` file! It's already in `.gitignore` but could still end up explicitly added if you  really try to push it.

Environment variables can also be declared in the terminal, such as the example below:

```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="yourtoken"
```

The token will be accessible within node as `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN`, and can be used to authenticate the GitHub client:

```
const GitHubApi = require('github');
const github = new GitHubApi({ debug: true });

github.authenticate({
  type: 'oauth',
  token: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN
});
```

Inspect the client you get back, and you'll see that it supports a variety of operations. Most of these return promises - this is because performing API requests means asking for data from a machine you don't immediately control over a network, and you can't depend on the timing (when it will return). Your code needs to account for this, for example to get user information:

```
let handle = "k33g";
github.users.getForUser({username: handle}).then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
});
```

The general pattern is `github.noun.verb()` - essentially every entity and action possible on GitHub is accessible in this fashion, so you can explore and use your imagination. You can retrieve stars, followers, repositories, or other things on a user basis, and if you're authorized you can also take actions (check stars on things, create repositories or gists, follow users, etc.). Read the [documentation on the API provided by this package](https://octokit.github.io/node-github/) for more details.

## Adding client-side encryption

We will be using [TweetNaCL](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js#usage). nacl is a fairly simple cryptosystem - it makes good default decisions using modern but well-tested algorithms. The included `package.json` also installs
`tweetnacl-util`, which provides utilities for encoding between strings and bytes. You can load both in your code as follows:

```
const nacl = require('tweetnacl');
nacl.util = require('tweetnacl-util');
```

Note that nacl prefers handling things as `Uint8Array` - that is, a bunch of numbers. You'll want to take a look at the `nacl.util` functions to translate between these and more user-friendly strings.

```
> nacl.util = require('tweetnacl-util');
{ decodeUTF8: [Function],
  encodeUTF8: [Function],
  encodeBase64: [Function],
  decodeBase64: [Function] }
```

Generally, the UTF8 functions are meant for the messages (UTF8 is a common encoding for human readable text), and the Base64 functions are meant for keys (you can encode the secret key to Base64 before giving it to the user to save "offline", and then decode it back from Base64 when reinitializing their keypair).

Getting this to work will require some experimentation - start `node` from the command line, require the modules, and interact with them. In general, you'll need `encodeUTF8 / decodeUTF8` functions to translate between human-readable text (the gist content you care about) and the
[Uint8Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array) that nacl works with natively. You'll also need the
`encodeBase64 / decodeBase64` functions to translate keys/nonces/ciphertext into representations that can be returned as a string (but aren't intended to be human readable).

### Symmetric crypto

Symmetric cryptography is done using `nacl.secretbox()`, and requires a single secret key as well as a unique random nonce on each execution. The output blob should be saved along with the nonce, which will then be used to decrypt it later. The nonce should be 24 bytes long and the key should be 32 bytes (the default values for nacl).

Both the key and nonce need to use good randomness - `nacl.randomBytes(length)` will provide this. You will also want to give the secret key to the user so they can save it ("offline" - assume they can keep it safe, like a passphrase) and use it later to decrypt things. Since asking users to save an array of numbers isn't great, use the utility functions to encode it for them. To read it back, for now you can just set it as an environment variable similar to the OAuth token.

Once you've encrypted the content of the gist, make sure to also include the nonce, otherwise you won't be able to decrypt it. The nonce can just be prepended to the encrypted content, and then the whole thing can be encoded and returned/saved as appropriate.

To decrypt, reverse the process - pick off the nonce, decode both nonce and encrypted content, decrypt the content with the nonce and the key, and return.

### Asymmetric crypto (optional)

The first thing you'll have to do is use `nacl.box.keyPair()` to generate a new public/private keypair. To regenerate the same keypair later, you should let the user retrieve their own private key (referred to as `secretKey` in nacl), and then when they start the application again setup with `nacl.box.keyPair.fromSecretKey(secretKey)`.

Once set up, nacl supports the standard range of asymmetric crypto operations - sign, encrypt, verify, decrypt. The "box/unbox" methods combine sign/encrypt and verify/decrypt, to make your life as a developer a bit easier. The main difference you'll have to worry about is returning both the public and private key to the user, and reinitializing the keypair from the private one.

At first box/unbox with the whole keypair, but you can add methods/routes to support passing in the public keys of other users - this would let you encrypt for them (so only they can decrypt), while signing with your private key (so they can verify the message really came from you by using your public key).

### Going further

There is a stubbed `/login` route and some suggestive comments at bottom of `app.js` - if you are interested, it's highly encouraged to take this app even further. In general, this could grow into a secure pastebin, where users can share notes and secrets with each other and not have to trust the host. This exploration is beyond the scope of your initial work, but is good to think about and absolutely worth exploring if you are so inclined.
